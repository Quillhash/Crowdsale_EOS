# Crowdsale_EOS
Basic Crowdsale smart contract in EOS. We will be issuing ```QUI``` token in exchange for ```SYS``` token of eosio.token contract after applying the rates. One can configure for the rates in ```config.h``` file that applies on the token after the crowdsale gets over.


#### Run the test cases
1. Locate both the files in your contract directory. 
2. Run ```python3 EOSCrowdsale/tests/test1.py```

#### Actions in Crowdsale smart contract 

```
ACTION init(eosio::name recipient, eosio::time_point_sec start, eosio::time_point_sec finish);
```

To initialize the crowdsale with name of recipient (account which will manage the crowdsale, pause the campaign or withdraw the EOS collected ):


```
ACTION buyquill(eosio::name from, eosio::name to, eosio::asset quantity, std::string memo);
```  

To transfer the tokens from account ```from``` to the account ```to```. It is redirected to “handle_investment” method where token transfer is managed & multi index table and states are managed. Fees can be charged in here. The deposits table in the smart contract is also updated.


```
ACTION transfer(eosio::name from, eosio::name to, eosio::asset quantity, std::string memo);
```  

To transfer the ```QUI``` tokens from account ```from``` to the account ```to```. The quilltoken contract holding all the ```QUI``` balances gets updated.

```
ACTION withdraw()
```

To withdraw all the EOS once the goal is achieved or the finish time set while initialising is passed by. It can be called by recipient only.


```
ACTION pause(); 
```

To avoid any discrepancies that may be present and for safety measure, crowdsale can be paused by the recipient at any moment of time. It acts as a toggle function so can be unpaused by calling the same action.



##### TABLE deposits
It holds all the account holders and their `QUI` they received for contributing for the crowdsale. 

##### Note: To buy QUI tokens, you need to call the transfer action of quilltoken and send the SYS to the crowdsaler account.
